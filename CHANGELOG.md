## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- **Category-Based Agent Organization**: Agents now organized by domain in subdirectories
  - `core/` - Core system agents (openagent, opencoder)
  - `meta/` - Meta-level agents (system-builder)
  - `development/` - Development specialists (frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, devops-specialist, codebase-agent)
  - `content/` - Content creation agents (copywriter, technical-writer)
  - `data/` - Data and analysis agents (data-analyst)
  - `product/` - Product management agents (directory created, ready for agents)
  - `learning/` - Education and coaching agents (directory created, ready for agents)
- **Category Metadata Files**: Each category has `0-category.json` documenting common subagents, tools, and context
- **Subagent Organization**: 13 subagents organized into 4 categories (code, core, system-builder, utils)
- **Local Registry Fallback**: Install script now supports local `registry.json` for development/testing
- **Enhanced Registry Validation**: Added checks for duplicate IDs and category consistency
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 15 automated validation tests for category system
- **Audit Tools**: Scripts to verify migration completeness and system integrity

### Changed
- **Agent File Structure**: Agents moved from flat structure to category-based organization
  - Example: `.opencode/agent/openagent.md` → `.opencode/agent/core/openagent.md`
  - Example: `.opencode/agent/opencoder.md` → `.opencode/agent/core/opencoder.md`
- **Registry Schema**: Updated to include category-based paths for all agents
- **Eval Framework**: Enhanced with path resolution supporting both agent IDs and category paths
  - `--agent=openagent` resolves to `core/openagent` (backward compatible)
  - `--agent=core/openagent` works directly (new format)
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs to reference category-based structure
- **Install Script**: Enhanced with local registry fallback for offline/development use

### Fixed
- **Frontend Specialist**: Renamed `frontend-design-agent.md` to `frontend-specialist.md` for consistency
- **Eval Directory Structure**: Archived legacy flat eval structure to `_archive/` for clarity
- **Registry Validation**: Fixed validation script to handle category-based paths correctly

### Developer Experience
- **Backward Compatibility**: Agent IDs like `openagent` still work via path resolution
- **Local Testing**: No need to push to GitHub to test registry changes
- **Clear Organization**: Agents grouped by domain make discovery easier
- **Validation Tools**: Automated tests ensure system integrity

### Migration Notes
- **Agent Paths**: Update references from flat to category-based paths
  - Old: `.opencode/agent/openagent.md`
  - New: `.opencode/agent/core/openagent.md`
- **Eval Framework**: Both formats work due to path resolution
  - `--agent=openagent` (backward compatible)
  - `--agent=core/openagent` (new format)
- **No Breaking Changes**: Path resolution maintains backward compatibility

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 14+ files updated for category structure
- **Agents Organized**: 23 total agents (10 category agents, 13 subagents)
- **Test Coverage**: 15/15 validation tests passing (100%)
- **Audit Status**: 8/8 checks passing (100%)

  - Root cause: Collision handling prompted for user input even in non-interactive mode
